He mentioned that they might choose to follow through with it after resolving the issue, or they might attempt to do it beforehand.

However, I assured them that I will connect as many people as possible through the SAU because this project involves educating high school students, which is one of their main concerns. I have provided them with a direct link to get in touch. I mentioned that we primarily want to address planting issues and other business-related matters, but there will also be multiple questions on other topics.

Therefore, when the time comes for collaboration, it would be beneficial to include it in the forest management plan. Currently, he is focusing on a forest management plan, while they are primarily concerned with conservation. They are prioritizing these aspects before discussing any potential structures. In fact, even if structures were to be considered, they would be minimal and primarily used for storage or other small purposes.",

If he decide to open up the trail system, there may be certain activities that he doesn't want to allow, such as ATVs. He has the ability to restrict that. However, if he wants to benefit from the current use tax break, he has to allow certain activities. For instance, he could consider allowing only snowmobiles, which provides a 2 million dollar liability policy. These are the options we have in front of us, and by agreeing to some of these conditions from the beginning, we can make progress and gain access to the property. This will encourage people to engage in recreational activities in different ways and support the idea he is trying to promote.

Instead of allowing them access to all 300 acres to roam wherever they please, it would be better to provide them with a main corridor to reach King Street, along with a connecting trail system.
