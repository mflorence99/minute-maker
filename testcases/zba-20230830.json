It's 7:00pm and time to begin the August meeting of the ZBA. \n\nI'll do introductions in a second but there's something we have to get out of the way first and that's that we've been asked by Pat Fone and Shellie Bueno, who are abutters of Mr. Crouss, to be allowed to speak. They can't be here unfortunately and the only way to do that is to get them on the phone. \n\nHowever, the ZBA rules of procedure don't contemplate virtual meetings. So what we're going to do first, I'm going to make a motion. I'll make it right now that we approve phone participation by these two abutters in this meeting. Do I have a second ?",

This session is also open to the public, and you are not only welcome but encouraged to stay and listen. During this session, the board members will discuss the evidence and arguments presented to us. We will then vote to either grant or deny the application in front of us. While you are welcome to observe, please note that the only discussion allowed is between the board members. You can see and hear everything, but you cannot comment.

The old shed is located pretty much on the property line, right on the corner. Additionally, there used to be a carport, but it was a temporary structure that couldn't withstand the heavy snowfall of 42 inches, so I had to take it down. Therefore, I believe it would be more practical to combine all these structures into one shed, preventing the presence of multiple dilapidated sheds and the carport. Moreover, this would also help in moving the shed away from the property line. However, the property's layout is somewhat limited due to a stonewall and steps leading down to the driveway.",

      "speech": "As the owner and abutter of 75 and 76 Hemlock Circle, my mother, Pat Fone, and I have concerns regarding the approval of the proposed project. The existence of five variances raises a red flag. Moreover, the fact that the project encroaches on our property line, which is already not in compliance with the law, is troubling. If they continue to encroach and get closer, it will negatively impact our ability to have a home, which is something we have been working towards. This encroachment will also compromise our privacy and obstruct our views from any future house.\n\nI was informed that there should be a 30-foot distance between buildings. However, if they are not required to stay within this limit and are allowed to be 18 feet away from the property line, which currently seems to be the case, it should be rectified. Regardless of whether this project is approved or not, we will have to adjust our building plans and move further back, which is unfair as it jeopardizes our ability to construct our dream home and maintain our privacy. The addition they propose does not seem necessary, and it appears they could build a smaller shed within the guidelines or find an alternative location or solution that does not encroach on someone else's property.\n\nThis land has been in our family for a long time, and although we have not been able to visit frequently due to COVID and my mother's illness last year, it holds sentimental value to us. We want to make use of the property and allow my mother to enjoy it while she is still with us. Our priority is to maintain our privacy and proceed with our plans without having to make changes due to someone else's failure to adhere to guidelines. This excessive construction of a large shed encroaching on someone else's property seems unnecessary and unfair.",

As it stands, he has already encroached upon our property boundary. Shouldn't he be more considerate? This raises another question - you are offering more property, but not actually granting us additional space, which goes against the law. In reality, you are not giving us anything back; instead, you are essentially reversing what should have been done. That's the structure of it. According to what she said, it was meant to be temporary, not meant to remain there. My mother is here with me and she is expressing the same sentiment in this message. Did you hear that? He mentioned that what was up there was supposed to be temporary, and now he wants to construct something permanent, which still exceeds the boundaries.",
