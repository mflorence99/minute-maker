Therefore, I believe it would be more practical to combine all these structures into one shed, preventing the presence of multiple dilapidated sheds and the carport. Moreover, this would also help in moving the shed away from the property line. However, the property's layout is somewhat limited due to a stonewall and steps leading down to the driveway.",

The existence of five variances raises a red flag. Moreover, the fact that the project encroaches on our property line, which is already not in compliance with the law, is troubling. If they continue to encroach and get closer, it will negatively impact our ability to have a home, which is something we have been working towards. This encroachment will also compromise our privacy and obstruct our views from any future house.\n\nI was informed that there should be a 30-foot distance between buildings. However, if they are not required to stay within this limit and are allowed to be 18 feet away from the property line, which currently seems to be the case, it should be rectified. Regardless of whether this project is approved or not, we will have to adjust our building plans and move further back, which is unfair as it jeopardizes our ability to construct our dream home and maintain our privacy. The addition they propose does not seem necessary, and it appears they could build a smaller shed within the guidelines or find an alternative location or solution that does not encroach on someone else's property.\n\nThis land has been in our family for a long time, and although we have not been able to visit frequently due to COVID and my mother's illness last year, it holds sentimental value to us. We want to make use of the property and allow my mother to enjoy it while she is still with us. Our priority is to maintain our privacy and proceed with our plans without having to make changes due to someone else's failure to adhere to guidelines. This excessive construction of a large shed encroaching on someone else's property seems unnecessary and unfair.",

By examining the drawing of the property, it can be observed that the distance between the rear corner of the lakeside of the garage and the front corner is greater. Therefore, I intended to discuss the location of the property or the garage itself, considering its proximity to the septic system.\n\nAt the time, the garage was constructed in accordance with the necessary regulations, as it was conforming. Unfortunately, I was unaware that it did not comply with the 50-foot frontal setback requirement. I had assumed that the engineer knew what he was doing and that my father had obtained a permit to build the garage. Consequently, I believed that the garage's location was intentional and justified. My intention was simply to add a carport to the existing structure.\n\nCurrently, I am in the process of selling my assets in Connecticut and relocating here in order to care for my parents. ",

The situation arose because my mother is wheelchair-bound and my father used to shovel the sidewalk. However, there was an incident in the past when my mother, who was using a walker at the time, slipped and fell on the sidewalk, resulting in a severe head injury. We nearly lost her due to this unfortunate accident.\n\nTo prevent such incidents from happening again, we decided to connect the garage to the house by constructing a covered walkway. We obtained the necessary permits and went through the State's approval process, ensuring that the construction followed all the required regulations. Now, I am seeking permission to utilize the parking area on the left side of the garage, which I believed was part of the variances being discussed today. This additional parking space would be beneficial, especially during winter weather conditions.\n\nI am in the process of relocating to this area to take care of my parents, and my house purchase is scheduled to close on Tuesday. The new property is significantly smaller, around five or six hundred square feet above a garage, compared to my previous 5000 square foot home on a lake in Connecticut. However, the decision to downsize was driven by the need to provide better care and accessibility for my parents, as evident from the circumstances I have described.\n\nRegrettably, I was unaware that our current setup does not comply with the coverage areas and setbacks regulations. Therefore, I am here today to request variances for all these aspects. I hope you can understand the importance of these modifications in ensuring the safety and well-being of my parents. ",

But when we looked closer and factored in the wetland, the size actually changed to something much smaller. It's important to consider this because the presence of the stream also influenced my experience there. If I could hear it with my hearing, which is very poor  according to my wife, it was very close.  \n\nBefore the recent rain, I can only imagine how much worse it was in July when we had a lot of rain and the lake almost overflowed. When I walk my dog in the morning, I have time to think, and I realized that there was probably no better place to put the shed building than where it is now. If we moved it to the center parking area, it would be even lower and encroach on the wetlands. Putting it next to the other barn seems like a bad plan because the highest spot is where it currently is.  \n\nI noticed that they actually made it a bit higher. You know, they brought in some riprap or whatever it's called, put it on blocks, and did some other stuff to raise it up in the air a little. And let me tell you, if the water manages to get into it now, he'd have a lot more than just a couple of inches. I mean, I think his cellar would be flooded with over a foot of water.

When we went there, instead of seeing the shed, we would have seen four markers in the ground. Regardless, we would have still come to the same conclusion. We would have walked around, taken some measurements, and determined that it should be 25 feet from the road. Honestly, the fact that the shed is there didn't really affect my thinking. It was nice to see it, but it wouldn't have made any difference to me. My thoughts on the matter would have remained the same.",
